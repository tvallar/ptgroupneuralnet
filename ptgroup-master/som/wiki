##### INSTALLATION #####
# Unfortunately CERN ROOT doesn't work very well with Python3 right now.
# The -Dpython3=ON flag doesn't work, and apparently there are still some issues with it.
# Theoretically you could try compiling with -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/python3 to get it to work, if you are adventurous.
# However, it is easier to just use Python2
# What to do?

### Install Python and libraries
sudo yum install python python2-pip python-devel python-virtualenv
virtualenv --system-site-packages ~/tensorflow
source ~/tensorflow/bin/activate
easy_install -U pip
pip install --upgrade tensorflow
pip install --ugprade pandas
pip install --upgrade numpy
pip install --upgrade matplotlib
pip install --upgrade root_numpy # do this after root is installed
# if you can't import all the dependencies of the file or get an error, try installing and/or upgrading the specified dependencies from the error message

### Install ROOT:
# Ensure git is installed, and cmake3, also should have gnumake, gcc, glibc etc.
sudo yum install git cmake3
cd ~/Downloads/
git clone http://github.com/root-project/root.git
git checkout v6-14-00
mkdir ~/root
cd ~/root
cmake3 ~/Downloads/root
cmake3 -- build . -- -j28

# now just open the environment and run analysis.py
source ~/tensorflow/bin/activate
cd /path/to/som.py
python /path/to/analysis.py

# you may need to change some of the environment paths, just copy the bashrc
cat bashrc >> ~/.bashrc

# install the CLAS libraries

# generate the events, see example input file for details
# run the script
# you may need to edit these scripts based on your system/needs
python multi.py

# make basic kinematic cuts and get the events we want
bash dat.sh
